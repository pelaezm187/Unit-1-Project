        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>At a very young age I grew to love coding websites - through simply right clicking on the sites and simply testing what each codes does. It was a puzzle game to me, tearing and building up my own personal blog site that was hosted by a friend who owned their own personal domain. As time has passed technology has grown, coding has changed, and I want to expand my education in creating websites and apps.</p>
        <p>I also have light knowledge in Painshop Pro and Adobe Photoshop. As most developers know, eye catching images are what attracts clients to keep coming back to a webpage. Below are snippets of my drawings I have created for my personal blog page. (Unfortunately the blog pages do not exist anymore.)</p>
